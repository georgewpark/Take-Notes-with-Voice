# Take Notes with Voice
This project demonstrates how the JavaScript speech recognition API can be used to retrieve a spoken note from a user and display that note on-screen with the ability to edit/delete notes and save them to local storage for later viewing.

The speech recognition API is currently only [supported by Chrome](https://caniuse.com/#search=speech%20recognition).

A live demo is available on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/GeorgePark/pen/jpovrm).
